Anyone who has traveled has experienced jet lag—that groggy realization that while your day is beginning in Washington, DC, the night you just left in San Francisco is hardly over. Jet lag is an inconvenient reminder that the body is set to a 24-hour clock, known by scientists as circadian rhythms, from the Latin circa dies, &quot;about one day.&quot; An internal biological clock is fundamental to all living organisms, influencing hormones that play a role in sleep and wakefulness, metabolic rate, and body temperature. 

Disruption of circadian rhythms not only affects sleep patterns but also has been found to precipitate mania in people with bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness). Other types of illnesses also are affected by circadian rhythms; for example, heart attacks occur more frequently in the morning while asthma attacks occur more often at night.

Although biological clocks have been the focus of intensive research over the past four decades, only recently have the tools needed to examine the molecular basis of circadian rhythms become available. Early studies pointed to an area of the brain, the hypothalamus, as the location of the circadian pacemaker in mammals. More recent findings show proteins called cryptochromes, located throughout the body, are also involved in detecting changes in light and setting the body's clock.

Genes that code for the clock protein, PER, glow in the head and other body parts of a fruit fly. Researchers made the clocks glow by engineering transgenic strains of flies in which the same genes that illuminate a jellyfish and a firefly's tail are attached to PER. The gene for luciferase, the enzyme that glows intermittently in fireflies, was expressed along with PER to reveal when the clock protein was being produced. Flies were also molecularly altered to brightly mark the clock sites with Green Fluorescent Protein, which glows constantly in jellyfish. Source: Jeffrey Plautz, Ph.D., Stanford University; Steve Kay, Ph.D., The Scripps Research Institute. 

The first circadian gene was discovered in 1971 in the fruit fly; a second circadian gene was detected 13 years later. Following these discoveries, however, the search for clock genes in other organisms faltered. Not until 1997 was the first circadian gene found in a mammalian model, the mouse. This discovery immediately accelerated the search for other clock genes, and findings in higher order animals are yielding a consistent picture of the role and function of circadian rhythms in organisms from bacteria to plants to mammals. 

Today, we know the most about the workings of the biological clock in the fruit fly and a peek inside its mechanisms illustrates the complex elegance of the rhythms of life. The fly's clock consists of a core system of four regulatory proteins that interact to give the clock periodicity. The cycle begins when two of these proteins, CLOCK and CYCLE, bind together and increase the production of two other proteins, PER and TIM, the levels of which slowly accumulate over time. When enough PER and TIM are made, they inactivate the CLOCK-CYCLE complex, slowing their own production and signaling the end of the cycle. 

Fruit fly clock cycle—Interaction of four regulatory proteins, entrained by light, creates the daily rhythm of the fruit fly's clock. The binding of CYCLE and CLOCK turns on genes that make PER and TIM, which accumulate over several hours until they reach levels that turn off CYCLE and CLOCK. This, in turn, slows down the production of PER and TIM, which begins the cycle all over again. Source: Steve Kay, Ph.D., and Karen Wager-Smith, Ph.D., The Scripps Research Institute. 

Although parts of the puzzle still are missing, discoveries stimulated by this progress are yielding intriguing findings. Proteins such as DBT (&quot;Double-Time&quot;) that act to fine tune the mechanism have been identified. Recently, variations have been found in the human Clock gene, which may predispose people to be &quot;early birds&quot; or &quot;night owls.&quot; Other research has linked academic and behavior problems in adolescents to irregular sleep patterns. 

Researchers have found that imposing too early school start times on children requires unrealistic bedtimes to allow adequate time for sleeping. Early school start times for adolescents are frequently associated with significant sleep deprivation, which can lead to academic, behavioral, and psychological problems, as well as increased risk for accidents and injuries, especially for teenage drivers. Completing our understanding of biological clockworks will lead to better treatments for diseases affected by circadian rhythm, as well as to methods of coping with disrupted sleep patterns.</text>

Although biological clocks have been the focus of intensive research over the past four decades, only recently have the tools needed to examine the molecular basis of circadian rhythms become available. Early studies pointed to an area of the brain, the [[hypothalamus]], as the location of the circadian pacemaker in mammals. More recent findings show proteins called [[cryptochrome]]s, located throughout the body, are also involved in detecting changes in light and setting the body's clock.

Genes that code for the clock protein, PER, glow in the head and other body parts of a fruit fly. Researchers made the clocks glow by engineering transgenic strains of flies in which the same genes that illuminate a jellyfish and a firefly's tail are attached to PER. The gene for [[luciferase]], the enzyme that glows intermittently in fireflies, was expressed along with PER to reveal when the clock protein was being produced. Flies were also molecularly altered to brightly mark the clock sites with Green Fluorescent Protein, which glows constantly in jellyfish.

The first circadian gene was discovered in 1971 in the fruit fly; a second circadian gene was detected 13 years later. Following these discoveries, however, the search for clock genes in other organisms faltered. It was not until 1997 that the first circadian gene was found in a mammalian model, the mouse. This discovery immediately accelerated the search for other clock genes, and findings in higher order animals are yielding a consistent picture of the role and function of circadian rhythms in organisms from [[bacteria]] to plants to mammals. 

Today, we know the most about the workings of the biological clock in the fruit fly and a peek inside its mechanisms illustrates the complex elegance of the rhythms of life. The fly's clock consists of a core system of four regulatory proteins that interact to give the clock periodicity. The cycle begins when two of these proteins, CLOCK and CYCLE, bind together and increase the production of two other proteins, PER and TIM, the levels of which slowly accumulate over time. When enough PER and TIM are made, they inactivate the CLOCK-CYCLE complex, slowing their own production and signaling the end of the cycle. 

'''Fruit fly clock cycle''' Interaction of four regulatory proteins, entrained by light, creates the daily rhythm of the fruit fly's clock. The binding of CYCLE and CLOCK turns on genes that make PER and TIM, which accumulate over several hours until they reach levels that turn off CYCLE and CLOCK. This, in turn, slows down the production of PER and TIM, which begins the cycle all over again.  

Although parts of the puzzle still are missing, discoveries stimulated by this progress are yielding intriguing findings. Proteins such as DBT (&quot;Double-Time&quot;) that act to fine tune the mechanism have been identified. Recently, variations have been found in the human clock gene, which may predispose people to be &quot;early birds&quot; or &quot;night owls.&quot; Other research has linked academic and behavior problems in adolescents to irregular sleep patterns. 

Researchers have found that imposing too early school start times on children requires unrealistic bedtimes to allow adequate time for sleeping. Early school start times for adolescents are frequently associated with significant sleep deprivation, which can lead to academic, behavioral, and psychological problems, as well as increased risk for accidents and injuries, especially for teenage drivers. Completing our understanding of biological clockworks will lead to better treatments for diseases affected by circadian rhythm, as well as to methods of coping with disrupted sleep patterns.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14681">'''Circadian oscillators''' are components of the biological clocks that regulate the activities of organisms in relation to environmental cycles and provide an internal temporal framework.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;/&gt; All [[circadian clock]]s, regardless of phylogenetic origin, consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow entrainment of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;Ueda, H.R., et al. 2005.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Konopka R.J., Benzer S. 1971, Clock mutants of ''Drosophila melanogaster''. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 68: 2112–2116&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, it was demonstrated that there is an underlying generative molecular mechanism of the circadian clock that consists of a set of core clock genes and their protein products, which together participate in positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback|feedback loops]] of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation]]. Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Bagiello T.A., Jackson, F.R., Young M.W. 1984. Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in ''Drosophila''. ''Nature'' 312: 752–754.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearman L.P., Sriram S., Weaver D.R., Maywood E.S., Chaves I., et al. 2000. Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock. ''Science'' 288: 1013–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1093/hmg/ddl207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;Gallego, M., and Virshup, D.M. 2007. Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock. ''Nature Reviews.'' 8: 139–148&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, M. and Schafmeier, T. 2006. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the circadian clocks of cyanhobacteria and ''Neurospora.'' ''Genes Dev.'' 20: 723–733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14625">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with the day-night cycle, driving [[circadian rhythm]]s. All circadian clocks, regardless of phylogenetic origin, consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow entrainment of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;Ueda, H.R., et al. 2005.

Network Features of the Mammalian Circadian Clock. ''PLoS Biol'' 7(3): e1000052. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Konopka R.J., Benzer S. 1971, Clock mutants of ''Drosophila melanogaster''. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 68: 2112–2116&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, it was demonstrated that there is an underlying generative molecular mechanism of the circadian clock that consists of a set of core clock genes and their protein products, which together participate in positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback|feedback loops]] of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation]]. Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Bagiello T.A., Jackson, F.R., Young M.W. 1984. Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in ''Drosophila''. ''Nature'' 312: 752–754.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearman L.P., Sriram S., Weaver D.R., Maywood E.S., Chaves I., et al. 2000. Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock. ''Science'' 288: 1013–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1093/hmg/ddl207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;Gallego, M., and Virshup, D.M. 2007. Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock. ''Nature Reviews.'' 8: 139–148&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, M. and Schafmeier, T. 2006. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the circadian clocks of cyanhobacteria and ''Neurospora.'' ''Genes Dev.'' 20: 723–733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the circadian clocks of cyanhobacteria and ''Neurospora.'' ''Genes Dev.'' 20: 723–733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14665">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. This is the central mechainsm which drives [[circadian rhythm]]s. Circadian clocks consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow entrainment of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;Ueda, H.R., et al. 2005.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Konopka R.J., Benzer S. 1971, Clock mutants of ''Drosophila melanogaster''. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 68: 2112–2116&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, it was demonstrated that there is an underlying generative molecular mechanism of the circadian clock that consists of a set of core clock genes and their protein products, which together participate in positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback|feedback loops]] of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation]]. Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Bagiello T.A., Jackson, F.R., Young M.W. 1984. Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in ''Drosophila''. ''Nature'' 312: 752–754.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearman L.P., Sriram S., Weaver D.R., Maywood E.S., Chaves I., et al. 2000. Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock. ''Science'' 288: 1013–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1093/hmg/ddl207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;Gallego, M., and Virshup, D.M. 2007. Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock. ''Nature Reviews.'' 8: 139–148&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, M. and Schafmeier, T. 2006. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the circadian clocks of cyanhobacteria and ''Neurospora.'' ''Genes Dev.'' 20: 723–733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14670">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;Ueda, H.R., et al. 2005.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Konopka R.J., Benzer S. 1971, Clock mutants of ''Drosophila melanogaster''. ''Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.'' 68: 2112–2116&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, it was demonstrated that there is an underlying generative molecular mechanism of the circadian clock that consists of a set of core clock genes and their protein products, which together participate in positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback|feedback loops]] of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[translation]]. Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Bagiello T.A., Jackson, F.R., Young M.W. 1984. Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in ''Drosophila''. ''Nature'' 312: 752–754.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearman L.P., Sriram S., Weaver D.R., Maywood E.S., Chaves I., et al. 2000. Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock. ''Science'' 288: 1013–19&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1093/hmg/ddl207}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;Gallego, M., and Virshup, D.M. 2007. Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock. ''Nature Reviews.'' 8: 139–148&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref&gt;Brunner, M. and Schafmeier, T. 2006. Transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulation of the circadian clocks of cyanhobacteria and ''Neurospora.'' ''Genes Dev.'' 20: 723–733&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16578">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | year = 2000 | month = May | pmid = 10807566 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16790">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi =10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | year = 2000 | month = May | pmid = 10807566 | doi =10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16815">  '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16816"> A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

Recent studies employing genomic approaches have further elucidated understanding of the circadian oscillator mechanism by providing a large-scale view into an organism's network and genetic architecture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | year = 2009 | month = October | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | year = 2009 | month = March | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi =10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | year = 2000 | month = May | pmid = 10807566 | doi =10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16814">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi =10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | year = 2000 | month = May | pmid = 10807566 | doi =10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms.

===Circadian regulation by phosphorylation===
[[Phosphorylation]] is the mechanism by which a phosphate group is added to a molecule changing its function or role in the cell.

===Regulation by sumolyation===
[[SUMOlyation]]

===Regulation by histone ubiquitination===
[[Ubiquitination]]

===Regulation by histone acetylation and methylation===
[[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]] is the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components.

Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16588">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol.

Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by Ronald Konopka and Semour Benzer in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16568">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16569">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout the organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi =10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | year = 2000 | month = May | pmid = 10807566 | doi =10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], heterodimerize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of Circadian Oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17036">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17037">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi =10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | year = 2000 | month = May | pmid = 10807566 | doi =10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a [[circadian clock]] by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[real-time polymerase chain reaction|quantitative RT-PCR analysis]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16986">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar mechanisms have been demonstrated in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi =10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | year = 2000 | month = May | pmid = 10807566 | doi =10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19355">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals.

Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793-806 | year = 2013 | month = November | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19354">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349-54 | year = 2012 | month = October | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724-36 | year = 2012 | month = December | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793-806 | year = 2013 | month = November | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum.

Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349-54 | year = 2012 | month = October | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724-36 | year = 2012 | month = December | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793-806 | year = 2013 | month = November | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period. &lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793-806 | year = 2013 | month = November | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20108">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period. &lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | year = 2013 | month = November | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20357">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | year = 2007 | month = February | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | year = 2006 | month = May | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | year = 2012 | month = October | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | year = 2012 | month = December | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | year = 2013 | month = November | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20365">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 | year = 2006 | month = October | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | year = 2012 | month = October | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | year = 2012 | month = December | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | year = 2013 | month = November | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period. &lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | year = 2013 | month = November | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period. &lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19856">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches.

[[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19857">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 |date=February 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum.

Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors.

Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19898">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20130">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

The clock ''in vitro'' was pioneered by [[Takao Kondo]]’s lab in [[Nagoya University]], Japan in 2005, who succeeded in reconstituting the circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial Kai C [[phosphorylation]] ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid | 15831759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20132">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol.

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum.

Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period.

In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20131">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20150">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light.

The clock ''in vitro'' was pioneered by [[Takao Kondo]]’s lab in [[Nagoya University]], Japan in 2005, who succeeded in reconstituting the circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial Kai C [[phosphorylation]] ''in vitro''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid | 15831759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol.

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20732">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum.

Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20736">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20734">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of 24 hours and is coordinated with the day-night cycle. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

==Transcriptional and translational control==
Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 |date=February 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 |date=May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the cicadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' in vitro led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to the delay that keeps the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes are when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bma1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bma1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20962">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.  The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness.  Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum.

Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

==Post-transcriptional modification==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21276">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.  The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness.  Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period.

==Post-translational modification==
The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumolyation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase I]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

==Regulation of circadian oscillators==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

==Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21274">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.  The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness.  Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science (New York, N.Y.) | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcriptional and translational control==

===Mammalian clocks===
Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

===Other organisms===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21287">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.  The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness.  Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

== Transcriptional and translational control ==

Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

=== Mammalian clocks ===

Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known component of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes ''Period'' genes (''[[PER1]]'', ''[[PER2]]'', and ''[[PER3]]'') and two ''Cryptochrome'' genes (''[[CRY1]]'' and ''[[CRY2]]''). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===

In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science (New York, N.Y.) | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==

For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==

The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==

Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==

Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking [[feedback]] loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol.

Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===

In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science (New York, N.Y.) | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==

For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==

The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==

Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==

Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21311">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.  The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness.  Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches.

Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process.

In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science (New York, N.Y.) | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==

For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==

The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==

Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==

Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21330">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.  The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness.  Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nat.

Evidence for a genetic basis of [[circadian rhythm]]s in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the ''[[period (gene)|period]]'' (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

== Post-translational modification ==

The autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a [[circadian rhythms|circadian molecular clock]]. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D]] and [[CSNK1E]]) and the F-box and leucine-rich repeat protein 3 ([[FBXL3]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, [[CSNK1E|Casein kinase 1 epsilon]] and [[CSNK1D|Casein kinase 1 delta]] are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in [[familial advanced sleep phase syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==

Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==

Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate [[circadian rhythms]] to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21243">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.

The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S| title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks| journal = Nat.

== Transcriptional and translational control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] ('per') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol.

Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates.

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21826">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.

The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S| title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks| journal = Nat.

== Transcriptional and translational control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] ('per') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol.

Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21856">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.

The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S| title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks| journal = Nat.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum.

REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21871">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily and seasonal changes in the day-night cycle.

The clock is a biochemical mechanism that oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms which drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S| title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks| journal = Nat.

For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals.

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period.

In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22148">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S| title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks| journal = Nat.

== Transcriptional and translational control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] ('per') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian clock genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock.

Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21980">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S| title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks| journal = Nat.

== Transcriptional and translational control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27643">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S| title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks| journal = Nat.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models has been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi =10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 |date=May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi =10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomita|first1=J|last2=Nakajima|first2=M|last3=Kondo|first3=T|last4=Iwasaki|first4=H|title=No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation.|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)|date=14 January 2005|volume=307|issue=5707|pages=251-4|pmid=15550625}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e. in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakajima|first1=M|last2=Imai|first2=K|last3=Ito|first3=H|last4=Nishiwaki|first4=T|last5=Murayama|first5=Y|last6=Iwasaki|first6=H|last7=Oyama|first7=T|last8=Kondo|first8=T|title=Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro.|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)|date=15 April 2005|volume=308|issue=5720|pages=414-5|pmid=15831759}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the Reddy laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Neill|first1=JS|last2=Reddy|first2=AB|title=Circadian clocks in human red blood cells.|journal=Nature|date=27 January 2011|volume=469|issue=7331|pages=498-503|doi=10.1038/nature09702|pmid=21270888}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27678">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal| author = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S| title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks| journal = Nat.

Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proc.

Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models has been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi =10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 |date=May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi =10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tomita|first1=J|last2=Nakajima|first2=M|last3=Kondo|first3=T|last4=Iwasaki|first4=H|title=No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation.|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)|date=14 January 2005|volume=307|issue=5707|pages=251-4|pmid=15550625}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e. in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nakajima|first1=M|last2=Imai|first2=K|last3=Ito|first3=H|last4=Nishiwaki|first4=T|last5=Murayama|first5=Y|last6=Iwasaki|first6=H|last7=Oyama|first7=T|last8=Kondo|first8=T|title=Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro.|journal=Science (New York, N.Y.)|date=15 April 2005|volume=308|issue=5720|pages=414-5|pmid=15831759}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the Reddy laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Neill|first1=JS|last2=Reddy|first2=AB|title=Circadian clocks in human red blood cells.|journal=Nature|date=27 January 2011|volume=469|issue=7331|pages=498-503|doi=10.1038/nature09702|pmid=21270888}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loudon|first1=AS|title=Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock.|journal=Current biology : CB|date=24 July 2012|volume=22|issue=14|pages=R570-1|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023|pmid=22835791}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reddy|first1=AB|last2=Rey|first2=G|title=Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes.|journal=Annual review of biochemistry|date=2014|volume=83|pages=165-89|doi=10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623|pmid=24606143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Qin|first1=X|last2=Byrne|first2=M|last3=Xu|first3=Y|last4=Mori|first4=T|last5=Johnson|first5=CH|title=Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system.|journal=PLoS biology|date=15 June 2010|volume=8|issue=6|pages=e1000394|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394|pmid=20563306}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 |date=October 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biol. | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 |date=March 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Hum. Mol. Genet. | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue = | pages = R271–7 |date=October 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nat.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 |date=October 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes Dev. | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 |date=December 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hayashi H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-Methylation-Dependent RNA Processing Controls the Speed of the Circadian Clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 |date=November 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27873">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid22622569&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models has been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e. in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the Reddy laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27473">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models has been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e. in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the Reddy laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and subsequently in mouse red blood cells&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27478">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models has been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the Reddy laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals.

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27497">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models has been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27576">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle [&lt;grammer? &quot;...'with' daily in the day-night cycle&quot;? What is being said here?]. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models has been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27577">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily in the day-night cycle [&lt;grammer? &quot;...'with' daily in the day-night cycle&quot;? What is being said here?]. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27529">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily [usage? Section needs editing] in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. In humans in a bunker, for example, their clocks are about 24.5 hours long, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism

The clock is reset as the environment changes through an organism's ability to sense external time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both endogenous and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]].

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27554">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly. Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed.

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27778">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light.

Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed.

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{vcite2 journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27389">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27389">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27699">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27720">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

and thats all folks

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27699">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O }}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews.

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27724">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27737">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27737">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.3 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27737">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PloS One | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27737">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27875">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours when it receives daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. {{citation needed|reason=unclear if this is true, what constitutes &quot;normal&quot; and what daily corrective signals consist of|date=April 2016}}Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27794">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24 hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24 hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27794">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in vertebrate species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, fungi, [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27802">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the term '''circadian'''.

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus - human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27772">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circadian oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27798">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28440">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells. 

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28446">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.{{cn}} 

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28465">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.{{cn|date=November 2016}} 

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28506">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27773695}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{cn|date=November 2016}} 

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28517">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

=== Mammalian clocks ===

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27773695}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28577">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28680">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
# A central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time
# A series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock
# A series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28682">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29141">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]]. 

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30150">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]]. 

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Synchronization-Induced Rhythmicity of Circadian Oscillators in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=3 |pmc=1851983 |author8=Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A |pmid=17432930 |last1=Bernard |first1=S |last2=Gonze |first2=D |last3=Cajavec |first3=B |last4=Herzel |first4=H |last5=Kramer |first5=A |issue=4 |pages=e68 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism. 

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30386">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]]. 

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Synchronization-Induced Rhythmicity of Circadian Oscillators in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=3 |pmc=1851983 |author8=Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A |pmid=17432930 |last1=Bernard |first1=S |last2=Gonze |first2=D |last3=Cajavec |first3=B |last4=Herzel |first4=H |last5=Kramer |first5=A |issue=4 |pages=e68 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enact principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription.

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30387">The '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', in most living things makes it possible for organisms to coordinate their biology and behavior with daily environmental changes in the day-night cycle. The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with a period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]]. 

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Synchronization-Induced Rhythmicity of Circadian Oscillators in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=3 |pmc=1851983 |author8=Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A |pmid=17432930 |last1=Bernard |first1=S |last2=Gonze |first2=D |last3=Cajavec |first3=B |last4=Herzel |first4=H |last5=Kramer |first5=A |issue=4 |pages=e68 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]].

=== Mammalian clocks ===

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31692">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that oscillates with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship to [[solar time]].  Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, averaged over an earth year, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to coordinate its biology and behavior with daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and derived diurnal behaviour patterns (e.g. [[crepuscular]] feeding). 

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate for lengthy intervals.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]]. 

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31746">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that oscillates with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship to [[solar time]].  Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, averaged over an earth year, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to coordinate its biology and behavior with daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and derived diurnal behaviour patterns (e.g. [[crepuscular]] feeding). 

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light.

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]]. 

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Synchronization-Induced Rhythmicity of Circadian Oscillators in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=3 |pmc=1851983 |author8=Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A |pmid=17432930 |last1=Bernard |first1=S |last2=Gonze |first2=D |last3=Cajavec |first3=B |last4=Herzel |first4=H |last5=Kramer |first5=A |issue=4 |pages=e68 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31775">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that oscillates with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship to [[solar time]].  Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, averaged over an earth year, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to coordinate its biology and behavior with daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and derived diurnal behaviour patterns (e.g. [[crepuscular]] feeding). 

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]]. 

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Synchronization-Induced Rhythmicity of Circadian Oscillators in the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus |journal=PLoS Computational Biology |volume=3 |pmc=1851983 |author8=Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A |pmid=17432930 |last1=Bernard |first1=S |last2=Gonze |first2=D |last3=Cajavec |first3=B |last4=Herzel |first4=H |last5=Kramer |first5=A |issue=4 |pages=e68 |doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31691">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that oscillates with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship to [[solar time]].  Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, averaged over an earth year, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to coordinate its biology and behavior with daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and derived diurnal behaviour patterns (e.g. [[crepuscular]] feeding). 

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]]. 

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C }}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K }}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31885">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that oscillates with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship to [[solar time]].  Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, averaged over an earth year, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to coordinate its biology and behavior with daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and derived diurnal behaviour patterns (e.g. [[crepuscular]] feeding).

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating KaiC with KaiA, KaiB, and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31897">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that oscillates with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship to [[solar time]].  Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, averaged over an earth year, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to coordinate its biology and behavior with daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and derived diurnal behaviour patterns (e.g. [[crepuscular]] feeding).

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29

&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31931">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that oscillates with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship to [[solar time]].  Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, averaged over an earth year, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to coordinate its biology and behavior with daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and derived diurnal behaviour patterns (e.g. [[crepuscular]] feeding).

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6 | volume=186 | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B |pages=947–968
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C | pmc=4142998}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O | pmc=3528576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 | pmc=4768355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31932">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that oscillates with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship to [[solar time]].  Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, averaged over an earth year, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to coordinate its biology and behavior with daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and derived diurnal behaviour patterns (e.g. [[crepuscular]] feeding).

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C | pmc=4142998}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O | pmc=3528576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 | pmc=4768355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31945">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a hypothetical biochemical oscillator that oscillates with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] relationship to [[solar time]]. 

Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, averaged over an earth year, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to coordinate its biology and behavior with daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and derived diurnal behaviour patterns (e.g. [[crepuscular]] feeding).

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as the day-night cycle), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms.

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31857">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that cycles with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] and is synchronized witho [[solar time]]. 

Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to anticipate daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and adjust its biology and behavior accordingly.

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as environmental light), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31856">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that cycles with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] and is synchronized with [[solar time]]. 

Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to anticipate daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and adjust its biology and behavior accordingly.

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as environmental light), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6 | volume=186 | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B |pages=947–968
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C | pmc=4142998}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O | pmc=3528576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 | pmc=4768355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32661">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that cycles with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] and is synchronized with [[solar time]]. 

Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to anticipate daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and adjust its biology and behavior accordingly.

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as environmental light), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C | pmc=4142998}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O | pmc=3528576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 | pmc=4768355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

== Variation in circadian clocks ==

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6 | volume=186 | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B |pages=947–968
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

Some spiders exhibit unusually long or short circadian clocks. Some species of [[Cyclosa|trashline orbweavers]], for example, have 18.5-hour circadian clocks, but are still able to entrain to a 24-hour cycle. This adaptation may help the spiders avoid predators by allowing them to be most active before sunrise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dana G.|title=Meet the Spiders That Completely Defy What We Know as Jet Lag|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meet-the-spiders-that-completely-defy-what-we-know-as-jet-lag/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=21 November 2017|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latrodectus|Black widows]]' clocks are arrhythmic, perhaps due to their preference for dark environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2017&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32650">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that cycles with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] and is synchronized with [[solar time]]. 

Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to anticipate daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and adjust its biology and behavior accordingly.

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as environmental light), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', plants, [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C | pmc=4142998}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O | pmc=3528576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

== Variation in circadian clocks ==

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6 | volume=186 | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B |pages=947–968
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

Some spiders exhibit unusually long or short circadian clocks. Some [[Cyclosa|trashline orbweavers]], for example, have 18.5-hour circadian clocks, but are still able to entrain to a 24-hour cycle. This adaptation may help the spiders avoid predators by allowing them to be most active before sunrise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dana G.|title=Meet the Spiders That Completely Defy What We Know as Jet Lag|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meet-the-spiders-that-completely-defy-what-we-know-as-jet-lag/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=21 November 2017|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latrodectus|Black widows]]' clocks are arrhythmic, perhaps due to their preference for dark environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2017&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32995">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that cycles with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] and is synchronized with [[solar time]]. 

Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to anticipate daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and adjust its biology and behavior accordingly.

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as environmental light), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light.

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

== Variation in circadian clocks ==

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6 | volume=186 | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B |pages=947–968
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

Some spiders exhibit unusually long or short circadian clocks. Some [[Cyclosa|trashline orbweavers]], for example, have 18.5-hour circadian clocks, but are still able to entrain to a 24-hour cycle. This adaptation may help the spiders avoid predators by allowing them to be most active before sunrise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dana G.|title=Meet the Spiders That Completely Defy What We Know as Jet Lag|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meet-the-spiders-that-completely-defy-what-we-know-as-jet-lag/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=21 November 2017|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latrodectus|Black widows]]' clocks are arrhythmic, perhaps due to their preference for dark environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guarino&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guarino|first1=Ben|title='It's crazy': These animals have the fastest circadian clocks found in nature|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/11/14/its-crazy-these-animals-have-the-fastest-circadian-clocks-found-in-nature/|accessdate=21 November 2017|work=Washington Post|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33011">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that cycles with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] and is synchronized with [[solar time]]. 

Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to anticipate daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and adjust its biology and behavior accordingly.

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as environmental light), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', [[TOC1_(gene)|plants]], [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in another system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C | pmc=4142998}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O | pmc=3528576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 | pmc=4768355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

== Variation in circadian clocks ==

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6 | volume=186 | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B |pages=947–968
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

Some spiders exhibit unusually long or short circadian clocks. Some [[Cyclosa|trashline orbweavers]], for example, have 18.5-hour circadian clocks, but are still able to entrain to a 24-hour cycle. This adaptation may help the spiders avoid predators by allowing them to be most active before sunrise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dana G.|title=Meet the Spiders That Completely Defy What We Know as Jet Lag|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meet-the-spiders-that-completely-defy-what-we-know-as-jet-lag/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=21 November 2017|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latrodectus|Black widows]]' clocks are arrhythmic, perhaps due to their preference for dark environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guarino&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guarino|first1=Ben|title='It's crazy': These animals have the fastest circadian clocks found in nature|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/11/14/its-crazy-these-animals-have-the-fastest-circadian-clocks-found-in-nature/|accessdate=21 November 2017|work=Washington Post|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33009">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that cycles with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] and is synchronized with [[solar time]]. 

Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to anticipate daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and adjust its biology and behavior accordingly.

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as environmental light), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', [[TOC1_(gene)|plants]], [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

== Transcriptional and non-transcriptional control ==
Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop.

Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

== Variation in circadian clocks ==

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6 | volume=186 | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B |pages=947–968
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

Some spiders exhibit unusually long or short circadian clocks. Some [[Cyclosa|trashline orbweavers]], for example, have 18.5-hour circadian clocks, but are still able to entrain to a 24-hour cycle. This adaptation may help the spiders avoid predators by allowing them to be most active before sunrise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dana G.|title=Meet the Spiders That Completely Defy What We Know as Jet Lag|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meet-the-spiders-that-completely-defy-what-we-know-as-jet-lag/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=21 November 2017|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latrodectus|Black widows]]' clocks are arrhythmic, perhaps due to their preference for dark environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guarino&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guarino|first1=Ben|title='It's crazy': These animals have the fastest circadian clocks found in nature|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/11/14/its-crazy-these-animals-have-the-fastest-circadian-clocks-found-in-nature/|accessdate=21 November 2017|work=Washington Post|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33344">A '''circadian clock''', or '''circadian oscillator''', is a biochemical oscillator that cycles with a stable [[phase (waves)|phase]] and is synchronized with [[solar time]]. 

Such a clock's ''in vivo'' period, is necessarily almost exactly 24 hours (the earth's current [[day|solar day]]). In most living things, internally synchronized circadian clocks make it possible for the organism to anticipate daily environmental changes corresponding with the day–night cycle and adjust its biology and behavior accordingly.

The term '''circadian''' derives from the Latin ''circa'' (about) ''diem'' (a day), since when taken away from external cues (such as environmental light), they do not run to exactly 24 hours. Clocks in humans in a lab in constant low light, for example, will average about 24.2 hours per day, rather than 24 hours exactly.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/1999/07.15/bioclock24.html|first=William|last=Cromie|title=Human Biological Clock Set Back an Hour|journal=Harvard Gazette|date=1999-07-15|accessdate=2015-07-29
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The normal body clock oscillates with an endogenous period of exactly 24 hours, it [[Entrainment (chronobiology)|entrains]], when it receives sufficient daily corrective signals from the environment, primarily daylight and darkness. Circadian clocks are the central mechanisms that drive [[circadian rhythm]]s. They consist of three major components:
* a central biochemical oscillator with a period of about 24 hours that keeps time;
* a series of input pathways to this central oscillator to allow [[entrainment (chronobiology)|entrainment]] of the clock;
* a series of output pathways tied to distinct phases of the oscillator that regulate overt rhythms in biochemistry, physiology, and behavior throughout an organism.

The clock is reset as an organism senses environmental time cues of which the primary one is light. Circadian oscillators are ubiquitous in tissues of the body where they are synchronized by both [[Endogeny (biology)|endogenous]] and external signals to regulate transcriptional activity throughout the day in a tissue-specific manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ueda&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueda HR, Hayashi S, Chen W, Sano M, Machida M, Shigeyoshi Y, Iino M, Hashimoto S | title = System-level identification of transcriptional circuits underlying mammalian circadian clocks | journal = Nature Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–92 | date = Feb 2005 | pmid = 15665827 | doi = 10.1038/ng1504 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock is intertwined with most cellular metabolic processes and it is affected by organism aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tevy MF, Giebultowicz J, Pincus Z, Mazzoccoli G, Vinciguerra M | title = Aging signaling pathways and circadian clock-dependent metabolic derangements | journal = Trends in Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 24 | issue = 5 | pages = 229–37 | date = May 2013 | pmid = 23299029 | doi = 10.1016/j.tem.2012.12.002 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1043276012002214 | pmc=3624052}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic molecular mechanisms of the biological clock have been defined in [[vertebrate]] species, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', [[TOC1_(gene)|plants]], [[fungi]], [[bacterial circadian rhythms|bacteria]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11687489&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harmer SL, Panda S, Kay SA | title = Molecular bases of circadian rhythms | journal = Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology | volume = 17 | issue =  | pages = 215–53 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11687489 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.cellbio.17.1.215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lowrey PL, Takahashi JS | title = Mammalian circadian biology: elucidating genome-wide levels of temporal organization | journal = Annual Review of Genomics and Human Genetics | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 407–41 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15485355 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.genom.5.061903.175925 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and presumably also in [[Archaea]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Edgar RS, Green EW, Zhao Y, van Ooijen G, Olmedo M, Qin X, Xu Y, Pan M, Valekunja UK, Feeney KA, Maywood ES, Hastings MH, Baliga NS, Merrow M, Millar AJ, Johnson CH, Kyriacou CP, O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Peroxiredoxins are conserved markers of circadian rhythms | journal = Nature | volume = 485 | issue = 7399 | pages = 459–64 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22622569 | pmc = 3398137 | doi = 10.1038/nature11088 |bibcode = 2012Natur.485..459E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12604787&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dvornyk V, Vinogradova O, Nevo E | title = Origin and evolution of circadian clock genes in prokaryotes | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 100 | issue = 5 | pages = 2495–500 | date = Mar 2003 | pmid = 12604787 | pmc = 151369 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0130099100 |bibcode = 2003PNAS..100.2495D }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid19424498&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitehead K, Pan M, Masumura K, Bonneau R, Baliga NS | title = Diurnally entrained anticipatory behavior in archaea | journal = PLOS ONE | volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = e5485 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19424498 | pmc = 2675056 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0005485 |bibcode = 2009PLoSO...4.5485W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vertebrate anatomy ==
In vertebrates, the master circadian clock is contained within the [[suprachiasmatic nucleus]] (SCN), a bilateral nerve cluster of about 20,000 neurons. The SCN itself is located in the [[hypothalamus]], a small region of the brain situated directly above the [[optic chiasm]], where it receives input from specialized [[intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells|photosensitive ganglion cell]]s in the retina via the [[retinohypothalamic tract]].

The SCN maintains control across the body by synchronizing &quot;slave oscillators&quot;, which exhibit their own near-24-hour rhythms and control circadian phenomena in local tissue.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernard S, Gonze D, Čajavec B, Herzel H, Kramer A | title = Synchronization-induced rhythmicity of circadian oscillators in the suprachiasmatic nucleus | journal = PLoS Computational Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = e68 | date = April 2007 | pmid = 17432930 | pmc = 1851983 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030068 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through intercellular signalling mechanisms such as [[vasoactive intestinal peptide]], the SCN signals other hypothalamic nuclei and the [[pineal gland]] to modulate [[body temperature]] and production of hormones such as [[cortisol]] and [[melatonin]]; these hormones enter the [[circulatory system]], and induce clock-driven effects throughout the organism.

It is not, however, clear precisely what signal (or signals) enacts principal entrainment to the many biochemical clocks contained in tissues throughout the body. See section &quot;regulation of circadian oscillators&quot; below for more details.

Evidence for a genetic basis of circadian rhythms in higher [[eukaryote]]s began with the discovery of the [[period (gene)|period]] (''per'') locus in ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from forward genetic screens completed by [[Ron Konopka]] and [[Seymour Benzer]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid5002428&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Konopka RJ, Benzer S | title = Clock mutants of Drosophila melanogaster | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 68 | issue = 9 | pages = 2112–6 | date = Sep 1971 | pmid = 5002428 | pmc = 389363 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.68.9.2112 | bibcode = 1971PNAS...68.2112K }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the analysis of ''per'' circadian mutants and additional mutations on ''Drosophila'' clock genes, a model encompassing positive and negative autoregulatory [[feedback]] loops of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and [[Translation (biology)|translation]] has been proposed. Core circadian 'clock' genes are defined as genes whose protein products are necessary components for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms. Similar models have been suggested in mammals and other organisms.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid6440029&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bargiello TA, Jackson FR, Young MW | title = Restoration of circadian behavioural rhythms by gene transfer in Drosophila | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | issue = 5996 | pages = 752–4 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6440029 | doi = 10.1038/312752a0 | bibcode = 1984Natur.312..752B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10807566&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shearman LP, Sriram S, Weaver DR, Maywood ES, Chaves I, Zheng B, Kume K, Lee CC, van der Horst GT, Hastings MH, Reppert SM | title = Interacting molecular loops in the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Science | volume = 288 | issue = 5468 | pages = 1013–9 | date = May 2000 | pmid = 10807566 | doi = 10.1126/science.288.5468.1013 | bibcode = 2000Sci...288.1013S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in cyanobacteria, however, changed our view of the clock mechanism, since it was found by Kondo and colleagues that these single-cell organisms could maintain accurate 24-hour timing in the absence of transcription, i.e. there was no requirement for a transcription-translation autoregulatory feedback loop for rhythms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tomita J, Nakajima M, Kondo T, Iwasaki H | title = No transcription-translation feedback in circadian rhythm of KaiC phosphorylation | journal = Science | volume = 307 | issue = 5707 | pages = 251–4 | date = Jan 2005 | pmid = 15550625 | doi = 10.1126/science.1102540 |bibcode = 2005Sci...307..251T }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, this clock was reconstructed in a test tube (i.e., in the absence of any cell components), proving that accurate 24-hour clocks can be formed without the need for genetic feedback circuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;/&gt; However, this mechanism was only applicable to cyanobacteria and not generic.

In 2011, a major breakthrough in understanding came from the [[Akhilesh Reddy|Reddy]] laboratory at the [[University of Cambridge]]. This group discovered circadian rhythms in redox proteins ([[peroxiredoxins]]) in cells that lacked a nucleus – human red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, Reddy AB | title = Circadian clocks in human red blood cells | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 498–503 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270888 | doi = 10.1038/nature09702 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..498O | pmc=3040566}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cells, there was no transcription or genetic circuits, and therefore no feedback loop. Similar observations were made in a marine alga&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Neill JS, van Ooijen G, Dixon LE, Troein C, Corellou F, Bouget FY, Reddy AB, Millar AJ | title = Circadian rhythms persist without transcription in a eukaryote | journal = Nature | volume = 469 | issue = 7331 | pages = 554–8 | date = Jan 2011 | pmid = 21270895 | doi = 10.1038/nature09654 |bibcode = 2011Natur.469..554O | pmc=3040569}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently in mouse red blood cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Cho CS, Yoon HJ, Kim JY, Woo HA, Rhee SG | title = Circadian rhythm of hyperoxidized peroxiredoxin II is determined by hemoglobin autoxidation and the 20S proteasome in red blood cells | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 33 | pages = 12043–8 | date = Aug 2014 | pmid = 25092340 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1401100111 |bibcode = 2014PNAS..11112043C | pmc=4142998}}&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, redox oscillations as demonstrated by peroxiredoxin rhythms have now been seen in multiple distant kingdoms of life (eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea), covering the evolutionary tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Edgar_2012&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Olmedo M, O'Neill JS, Edgar RS, Valekunja UK, Reddy AB, Merrow M | title = Circadian regulation of olfaction and an evolutionarily conserved, nontranscriptional marker in Caenorhabditis elegans | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 50 | pages = 20479–84 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23185015 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211705109 |bibcode = 2012PNAS..10920479O | pmc=3528576}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, redox clocks look to be the '''grandfather clock''', and genetic feedback circuits the major output mechanisms to control cell and tissue physiology and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=MacKenzie|first1=Debora|title=Biological clock began ticking 2.5 billion years ago | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21428653.900-biological-clock-began-ticking-25-billion-years-ago.html|website=New Scientist|publisher=New Scientist}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Loudon AS | title = Circadian biology: a 2.5 billion year old clock | journal = Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 14 | pages = R570-1 | date = Jul 2012 | pmid = 22835791 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.06.023 | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the model of the clock has to be considered as a product of an interaction between both transcriptional circuits and non-transcriptional elements such as redox oscillations and protein phosphorylation cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Reddy AB, Rey G | title = Metabolic and nontranscriptional circadian clocks: eukaryotes | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 83 | pages = 165–89 | date = 2014 | pmid = 24606143 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-biochem-060713-035623 | pmc=4768355}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Qin X, Byrne M, Xu Y, Mori T, Johnson CH | title = Coupling of a core post-translational pacemaker to a slave transcription/translation feedback loop in a circadian system | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 6 | pages = e1000394 | date = 15 June 2010 | pmid = 20563306 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000394 | pmc=2885980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mammalian clocks ===
Selective [[gene knockdown]] of known components of the human circadian clock demonstrates both active compensatory mechanisms and redundancy are used to maintain function of the clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang EE, Liu AC, Hirota T, Miraglia LJ, Welch G, Pongsawakul PY, Liu X, Atwood A, Huss JW, Janes J, Su AI, Hogenesch JB, Kay SA | title = A genome-wide RNAi screen for modifiers of the circadian clock in human cells | journal = Cell | volume = 139 | issue = 1 | pages = 199–210 | date = Oct 2009 | pmid = 19765810 | pmc = 2777987 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2009.08.031 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baggs JE, Price TS, DiTacchio L, Panda S, Fitzgerald GA, Hogenesch JB | title = Network features of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 7 | issue = 3 | pages = e52 | date = Mar 2009 | pmid = 19278294 | pmc = 2653556 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.1000052 | editor1-last = Schibler | editor1-first = Ueli }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several mammalian clock genes have been identified and characterized through experiments on animals harboring naturally occurring, chemically induced, and targeted knockout mutations, and various comparative genomic approaches. The majority of identified clock components are transcriptional activators or repressors that modulate protein stability and nuclear translocation, and create two interlocking feedback loops.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ko CH, Takahashi JS | title = Molecular components of the mammalian circadian clock | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 15 Spec No 2 | issue =  | pages = R271-7 | date = Oct 2006 | pmid = 16987893 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddl207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the primary feedback loop, members of the [[basic helix-loop-helix]] (bHLH)-PAS (Period-Arnt-Single-minded) transcription factor family, [[CLOCK]] and [[ARNTL|BMAL1]], [[heterodimer]]ize in the cytoplasm to form a complex that, following translocation to the nucleus, initiates transcription of target genes such as the core clock genes 'period' genes ([[PER1]], [[PER2]], and [[PER3]]) and two cryptochrome genes ([[CRY1]] and [[CRY2]]). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription by inhibiting the activity of the CLOCK:BMAL1 complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lowrey&quot;/&gt; Another regulatory loop is induced when CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activate the transcription of [[Rev-ErbA]] and Rora, two retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors. REV-ERBa and RORa subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in Bmal1 promoter. Through the subsequent binding of ROREs, members of ROR and REV-ERB are able to regulate ''Bmal1''. While RORs activate transcription of ''Bmal1'', REV-ERBs repress the same transcription process. Hence, the circadian oscillation of ''Bmal1'' is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

=== Other organisms ===
In ''D. melanogaster'', the gene cycle (CYC) is the orthologue of BMAL1 in mammals. Thus, CLOCK–CYC dimers activate the transcription of circadian genes. The gene timeless (TIM) is the orthologue for mammalian CRYs as the inhibitor; ''D. melanogaster'' CRY functions as a photoreceptor instead. In flies, CLK–CYC binds to the promoters of circadian-regulated genes only at the time of transcription. A stabilizing loop also exists where the gene vrille (VRI) inhibits whereas PAR-domain protein-1 (PDP1) activates Clock transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gallego M, Virshup DM | title = Post-translational modifications regulate the ticking of the circadian clock | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 139–48 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17245414 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In other organisms such as the filamentous fungus ''N. crassa'', the clock mechanism is analogous, but non-orthologous, to that of mammals and flies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16651653&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner M, Schafmeier T | title = Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock of cyanobacteria and Neurospora | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 20 | issue = 9 | pages = 1061–74 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16651653 | doi = 10.1101/gad.1410406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The circadian clock mechanism in plants also includes interlocking feedback loops of gene regulation but their components, such as [[TOC1_(gene)|TOC1]], [[CCA1]] and the [[ELF4|Evening Complex]], are from different protein families than the animal, fungal and bacterial clock proteins.

In [[bacterial circadian rhythms]], the oscillations of the [[phosphorylation]] of [[cyanobacterial]] Kai C protein was reconstituted in a cell free system (an ''in vitro'' clock) by incubating [[KaiC]] with [[KaiA]], [[KaiB]], and [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15831759&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nakajima M, Imai K, Ito H, Nishiwaki T, Murayama Y, Iwasaki H, Oyama T, Kondo T | title = Reconstitution of circadian oscillation of cyanobacterial KaiC phosphorylation in vitro | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5720 | pages = 414–5 | date = Apr 2005 | pmid = 15831759 | doi = 10.1126/science.1108451 |bibcode = 2005Sci...308..414N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-transcriptional modification ==
For a long time it was thought the transcriptional activation/repression cycles driven by the transcriptional regulators constituting the circadian clock was the main driving force for circadian gene expression in mammals. More recently, however, it was reported that only 22% of messenger RNA cycling genes are driven by de novo transcription.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koike&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Koike N, Yoo SH, Huang HC, Kumar V, Lee C, Kim TK, Takahashi JS | title = Transcriptional architecture and chromatin landscape of the core circadian clock in mammals | journal = Science | volume = 338 | issue = 6105 | pages = 349–54 | date = Oct 2012 | pmid = 22936566 | doi = 10.1126/science.1226339 |bibcode = 2012Sci...338..349K | pmc=3694775}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNA-level post-transcriptional mechanisms driving rhythmic protein expression were later reported, such as mRNA polyadenylation dynamics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kojima&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kojima S, Sher-Chen EL, Green CB | title = Circadian control of mRNA polyadenylation dynamics regulates rhythmic protein expression | journal = Genes &amp; Development | volume = 26 | issue = 24 | pages = 2724–36 | date = Dec 2012 | pmid = 23249735 | doi = 10.1101/gad.208306.112 | pmc=3533077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fustin and co-workers identified methylation of internal adenosines (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) within mRNA (notably of clock transcripts themselves) as a key regulator of the circadian period. Inhibition of m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylation via pharmacological inhibition of cellular methylations or more specifically by siRNA-mediated silencing of the m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A methylase ''Mettl3'' led to the dramatic elongation of the circadian period. In contrast, overexpression of ''Mettl3'' ''in vitro'' led to a shorter period. These observations clearly demonstrated the importance of RNA-level post-transcriptional regulation of the circadian clock, and concurrently established the physiological role of (m&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;A) RNA methylation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fustin JM, Doi M, Yamaguchi Y, Hida H, Nishimura S, Yoshida M, Isagawa T, Morioka MS, Kakeya H, Manabe I, Okamura H | title = RNA-methylation-dependent RNA processing controls the speed of the circadian clock | journal = Cell | volume = 155 | issue = 4 | pages = 793–806 | date = Nov 2013 | pmid = 24209618 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2013.10.026 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-translational modification ==
The autoregulatory feedback loops in clocks take about 24 hour to complete a cycle and constitute a circadian molecular clock. This generation of the ~24-hour molecular clock is governed by post-translational modifications such as [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], [[histone acetylation]] and [[methylation]], and [[ubiquitination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; Reversible phosphorylation regulates important processes such as nuclear entry, formation of protein complexes and protein degradation. Each of these processes significantly contributes to keeping the period at ~24 hours and lends the precision of a circadian clock by affecting the stability of aforementioned core clock proteins. Thus, while transcriptional regulation generates rhythmic RNA levels, regulated posttranslational modifications control protein abundance, subcellular localization, and repressor activity of PER and CRY.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

Proteins responsible for post-translational modification of clock genes include [[casein kinase]] family members ([[CSNK1D|casein kinase 1 delta]] (CSNK1D) and [[CSNK1E|casein kinase 1 epsilon]] (CSNK1E) and the F-box [[FBXL3|leucine-rich repeat protein 3]] (FBXL3).&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; In mammals, CSNK1E and CSNK1D are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; Experimental manipulation on either of these proteins results in dramatic effects on circadian periods, such as altered kinase activities and cause shorter circadian periods, and further demonstrates the importance of the post-translational regulation within the core mechanism of the circadian clock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt; These mutations have become of particular interest in humans as they are implicated in the [[advanced sleep phase disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallego&quot;/&gt; A small ubiquitin-related modifier protein modification of BMAL1 has also been proposed as another level of post-translational regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ko&quot;/&gt;

== Regulation of circadian oscillators ==
Circadian oscillators are simply oscillators with a period of approximately 24 hours. In response to light stimulus the body corresponds with a system and network of pathways that work together to determine the biological day and night. The regulatory networks involved in keeping the clock precise span over a range of post-translation regulation mechanisms. Circadian oscillators may be regulated by [[phosphorylation]], SUMOylation, [[ubiquitination]], and [[histone acetylation and deacetylation]], the covalent modification of the histone tail which controls the level of chromatin structures causing the gene to be expressed more readily. [[Methylation]] of a protein structure adds a methyl group and regulates the protein function or gene expression and in histone methylation gene expression is either suppressed or activated through changing the DNA sequence. Histones go through an acetylation, methylation and phosphorylation process but the major structural and chemical changes happen when enzymes ''[[histone acetyltransferase]]s'' (HAT) and ''[[histone deacetylase]]s'' (HDAC) add or remove acetyl groups from the histone causing a major change in DNA expression. By changing DNA expression, histone acetylation and methylation regulate how the circadian oscillator operates. Fustin and co-workers provided a new layer of complexity to the regulation of circadian oscillator in mammals by showing that RNA methylation was necessary for efficient export of mature mRNA out of the nucleus: inhibition of RNA methylation caused nuclear retention of clock gene transcripts, leading to a longer circadian period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fustin&quot;/&gt;

A key feature of clocks is their ability to synchronize to external stimuli. The presence of cell autonomous oscillators in almost every cell in the body raises the question of how these oscillators are temporally coordinated. The quest for universal timing cues for peripheral clocks in mammals has yielded principal entrainment signals such as feeding, temperature, and oxygen. Both feeding rhythms and temperature cycles were shown to synchronize peripheral clocks and even uncouple them from the master clock in the brain (e.g., daytime restricted feeding). Recently, oxygen rhythms were found to synchronize clocks in cultured cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Rhythmic Oxygen Levels Reset Circadian Clocks through HIF1a|journal=Cell Metabolism|volume=|pmid=27773695|doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2016.09.014|year=2016|vauthors=Adamovich Y, Ladeuix B, Golik M, Koeners MP, Asher G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Systems biology approaches to elucidate oscillating mechanisms ==
Modern experimental approaches using [[systems biology]] have identified many novel components in biological clocks that suggest an integrative view on how organisms maintain circadian oscillation.&lt;ref name= &quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt;

Recently, Baggs et al. developed a novel strategy termed &quot;Gene Dosage Network Analysis&quot; (GDNA) to describe network features in the human circadian clock that contribute to an organism's robustness against genetic perturbations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; In their study, the authors used [[small interfering RNA]] (siRNA) to induce dose-dependent changes in gene expression of clock components within immortalized human osteosarcoma U2OS cells in order to build gene association networks consistent with known biochemical constraints in the mammalian circadian clock. Employing multiple doses of siRNA powered their [[quantitative PCR]] to uncover several network features of the circadian clock, including proportional responses of gene expression, signal propagation through interacting modules, and compensation through gene expression changes.

Proportional responses in downstream gene expression following [[small interfering RNA|siRNA-induced perturbation]] revealed levels of expression that were actively altered with respect to the gene being knocked down. For example, when Bmal1 was knocked down in a dose-dependent manner, [[Rev-ErbA alpha]] and [[Rev-ErbA beta]] mRNA levels were shown to decrease in a linear, proportional manner. This supported previous findings that Bmal1 directly activates Rev-erb genes and further suggests Bmal1 as a strong contributor to Rev-erb expression.

In addition, the GDNA method provided a framework to study biological relay mechanisms in circadian networks through which modules communicate changes in gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; The authors observed signal propagation through interactions between activators and repressors, and uncovered unidirectional paralog compensation among several clock gene repressors—for example, when [[PER1]] is depleted, there is an increase in Rev-erbs, which in turn propagates a signal to decrease expression in [[BMAL1]], the target of the Rev-erb repressors.

By examining knockdown of several transcriptional repressors, GDNA also revealed paralog compensation where gene paralogs were upregulated through an active mechanism by which gene function is replaced following knockdown in a nonredunant manner—that is, one component is sufficient to sustain function. These results further suggested that a clock network utilizes active compensatory mechanisms rather than simple redundancy to confer robustness and maintain function. In essence, the authors proposed that the observed network features act in concert as a genetic buffering system to maintain clock function in the face of genetic and environmental perturbation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggs&quot;/&gt; Following this logic, we may use [[genomics]] to explore network features in the circadian oscillator.

Another study conducted by Zhang et al. also employed a genome-wide [[small interfering RNA]] screen in U2OS cell line to identify additional clock genes and modifiers using luciferase reporter gene expression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhang&quot;/&gt; Knockdown of nearly 1000 genes reduced rhythm amplitude. The authors found and confirmed hundreds of potent effects on [[periodic function|period]] length or increased amplitude in secondary screens. Characterization of a subset of these genes demonstrated a dosage-dependent effect on [[oscillator]] function. Protein interaction network analysis showed that dozens of gene products directly or indirectly associate with known clock components. Pathway analysis revealed these genes are overrepresented for components of [[insulin]] and [[hedgehog signaling pathway]], the [[cell cycle]], and folate metabolism. Coupled with data demonstrating that many of these pathways are clock-regulated, Zhang et al. postulated that the clock is interconnected with many aspects of cellular function.

A [[systems biology]] approach may relate circadian rhythms to cellular phenomena that were not originally considered regulators of circadian oscillation.  For example, a 2014 workshop&lt;ref name=&quot;workshop&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/research/reports/2014-circadian-clock-lung-health.htm |title=NHLBI Workshop:  &quot;Circadian Clock at the Interface of Lung Health and Disease&quot; April 28-29, 2014 Executive Summary  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website= |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute |accessdate=20 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[NHLBI]] assessed newer circadian genomic findings and discussed the interface between the body clock and many different cellular processes.

== Variation in circadian clocks ==

While a precise 24-hour circadian clock is found in many organisms, it is not universal. Organisms living in the high arctic or high antarctic do not experience solar time in all seasons, though most are believed to maintain a circadian rhythm close to 24 hours, such as bears during torpor.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=The bear circadian clock doesn't 'sleep' during winter dormancy |doi=10.1186/s12983-016-0173-x | volume=13 | journal=Frontiers in Zoology
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the earth's biomass resides in the dark biosphere, and while these organisms may exhibit rhythmic physiology, for these organisms the dominant rhythm is unlikely to be circadian.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title=Life in a dark biosphere: a review of circadian physiology in &quot;arrhythmic&quot; environments |doi=10.1007/s00360-016-1000-6 | volume=186 | journal=Journal of Comparative Physiology B |pages=947–968
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For east-west migratory organisms—and especially should an organism circumnavigate the globe&lt;!-- circumnavigating whales at 40°S ??? --&gt;—the absolute 24-hour phase might deviate over months, seasons, or years.

Some spiders exhibit unusually long or short circadian clocks. Some [[Cyclosa|trashline orbweavers]], for example, have 18.5-hour circadian clocks, but are still able to entrain to a 24-hour cycle. This adaptation may help the spiders avoid predators by allowing them to be most active before sunrise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2017&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Dana G.|title=Meet the Spiders That Completely Defy What We Know as Jet Lag|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/meet-the-spiders-that-completely-defy-what-we-know-as-jet-lag/|website=Scientific American|accessdate=21 November 2017|date=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Latrodectus|Black widows]]' clocks are arrhythmic, perhaps due to their preference for dark environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guarino&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guarino|first1=Ben|title='It's crazy': These animals have the fastest circadian clocks found in nature|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/11/14/its-crazy-these-animals-have-the-fastest-circadian-clocks-found-in-nature/|accessdate=21 November 2017|work=Washington Post|date=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
